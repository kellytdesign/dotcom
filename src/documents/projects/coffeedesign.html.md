In January 2014, I founded and co-launched Coffee & Design in Kansas City on a mission to fill a gap in the design community. C&D is a free, monthly event series set out to connect, grow, & inspire design professionals.

To continue community building, C&D powers Design On Tap, an informal gathering of designers over drinks; as well as a virtual co-working space to help foster connections and interactions.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on bringing Coffee & Design to other cities across the country.
