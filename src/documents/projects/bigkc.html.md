Through Cremalab, I had a wonderful opportunity to create the concept and identity design for the 2013 Big Kansas City conference. Since it was the innaugural event, I wanted to pay homage to the entrepreneurial roots of Kansas City, but pull in the technology and innovation of today. I created custom iconography to represent different Kansas City historical roots with a rough vintage feel, pulling in colour to help creatve vibrancy. 

Design work included: concept, logo, custom iconography, responsive web design, social media assets, conference collateral including signage, badges, lanyards, photo booth props, stickers, tshirts, and other digital pieces.
