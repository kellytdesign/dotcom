Handlettering has always been one of those “one day” things for me. One of those things that you’re both so in awe of and yet so envious of, and you tell yourself that “one day” you’ll do something about it. After years of putting off “one day” I finally decided to letter on sticky notes for thirty days straight and publish every single of them no matter how much I thought they sucked. The idea behind this was to challenge myself to carve out time for something I simply wanted to do, get over the idea of publishing perfection, and most importantly: to kickstart learning to letter.
