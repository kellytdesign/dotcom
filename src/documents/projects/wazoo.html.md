What started out as a 60-second pitch, to first place at Kansas City Startup Weekend 6, to a paid client and AppStore launch, Wazoo! is an application set out to change the way childrenâ€™s museums and discovery centers are experienced. This product includes a client admin portal that pushes and recieves content to and from the iOS application. My involvement as founder included overall design and branding, product design and ideation, project managment, client relations, business development, and pitching to investors.
