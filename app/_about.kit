<section class="section about">
  <h1 class="primary-text">I'm Kelly Tomlinson</h1>
  <p>I craft digital experiences that delight people and help solve their problems, no matter the scale. Throughout my career I’ve spent time in most areas of the product design process from discovery, feature development, architecture, user flows, visual design, product ownership, and product management. My time in all of these spaces have shaped me into an exceptional designer that advocates for the user while balancing business needs within a beautiful cross-device experience.</p>
  <p>I’m passionate about end-to-end experiences, building and strengthening design communities, good food and good people. I believe in solving problems, sharing stories, saying thank you, and small joys.</p>
