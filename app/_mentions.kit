    <p>In 2014 I founded <a href="http://www.idsa.org/news/chapter-news/coffee-and-design-monthly-event">Coffee & Design</a>, a not-for-profit on a mission to inspire, connect, and grow the professional design community in Kansas City. I co-chaired <a href="http://www.kcdesignweek.org/">KC Design Week</a> 2018 & 2017, serving on the committee since 2015. Previously my involvement was in the KC startup and entrepreneur community with a Startup Weekend win in 2012. I’ve had the honor to speak at the <a href="https://www.aafkc.com/news/gas-can-creative-conference-2015-speaker-lineup">2015 Gas Can Creative Conference</a>,  <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/bizventures-kc/2015/04/fail-fast-and-other-tips-from-top-women-in-kc.html">2015 Middle of the Map Fest Forum</a>, and the 2014 UP Global Summit. In 2017 I was named Ink Magazine’s 30 under 30.</p>
