<p>In January 2014, I founded and co-launched Coffee &amp; Design in Kansas City on a mission to fill a gap in the design community. C&amp;D is a free, monthly event series set out to connect, grow, &amp; inspire design professionals.</p>
<p>To continue community building, C&amp;D powers Design On Tap, an informal gathering of designers over drinks; as well as a virtual co-working space to help foster connections and interactions.</p>
<p>Currently, Iâ€™m working on bringing Coffee &amp; Design to other cities across the country.</p>
